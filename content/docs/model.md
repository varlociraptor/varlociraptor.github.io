Underlying varlociraptor is a novel theory of variant calling that is able to handle all length ranges (from small to SV) in a unified way, while allowing to include any kind of uncertainty (mapping, typing, strand, read orientation, ...).
The basics of the model are described in the [initial publication](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-01993-6), which focuses on the application on tumor/normal variant calling.
In the future, we will publish another manuscript that describes Varlociraptor's generic calling mechanisms.
