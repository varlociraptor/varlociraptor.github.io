In particular, you can also first combine candidates from different callers, to cover diverse variant types and length ranges.\nLet candidates.bcf be the set of candidate variant calls (VCF or BCF format, see bcftools).\nLet reference.fa be the reference genome FASTA file (indexed with samtools).\nPreprocessing per-sample observations\nFirst, varlociraptor requires to preprocess the candidate variants in order to obtain per-sample observations for the actual calling process.\nLet sample.bam be the aligned reads of the sample to preprocess, and let sample.alignment-properties.json be the corresponding alignment property file obtained by running varlociraptor estimate alignment-properties, see Estimating properties.\nAssumptions\n\nWhile varlociraptor does not require a particular read aligner, it assumes that provided mapping qualities (MAPQ) are as accurate as possible, and that too large indels are encoded as softclips (i.e. it expects BAMs in bwa mem style).\nBy default, varlociraptor assumes that given candidate variants are merged into small haplotypes (given as MNVs or more complex replacements like provided e.g. by freebayes). If your candidates do not satisfy this assumption (i.e. are rather \"atomic\"), you should\nactivate the flag --atomic-candidate-variants. This will deactivate realignment for SNVs and MNVs in varlociraptor, because that can induce false positives in case variants close by that are in phase are given in as individual records.\n\nExecuting preprocessing\nPreprocessing can be started with\n\nIn other words, the candidate variants are piped into varlociraptor (with the &lt; shell operator) and observations are piped into sample.observations.bcf (with the &gt; shell operator).\nNote that the candidate variants (here candidates.bcf) have to be the same for each sample.\nThis can be achieved by either jointly calling across all samples (as possible with most variant callers), or by merging candidates from all involved samples into a single VCF/BCF file.\nFrom the candidate variant file, only CHROM, POS, REF, ALT, EVENT, MATEID, END, and SVLEN (if present) are used. Other fields are ignored.\nThe EVENT and MATEID fields thereby groups variants into a common haplotype.\nFor breakends this happens as defined in the VCF specification.\nFor other types of variants the same semantic is used: all variants that have the same value in their EVENT tag are considered to be in the same haplotype and the model will calculate the read support for the entire haplotype.\nIn case of MATEID, variants are considered to be of the same haplotype if the set of ID and MATEID is the same. This is usually true for a pair of records, which reciprocally refer to each others IDs via the MATEID field.\nVariant types that are not (yet) supported by Varlociraptor will be dropped (with notification on STDERR).\nParallelization\nInstead of offering internal parallelization, varlociraptor preprocess variants should be parallelized via a scatter-gather.\nThat means that you first split the candidates.bcf into chunks of equal size.\nThis can best be done via Rust-Bio-Tools (rbt), which offers a subcommand for splitting VCF/BCF files while properly handling events that span multiple records (breakend events with SVTYPE=BND).\nFor example, with\n\nthe candidates.bcf is split into 16 chunks of approximately equal size.\nAfter applying varlociraptor preprocess variants and also the calling steps described below (and, depending on the research question, a variant annotation tool like VEP), the processed chunks can be merged again.\nIf the input candidates did contain breakend variants (SVTYPE=BND, which only happens when generated by structural variant callers), they have to be sorted first e.g., via bcftools sort.\nMerging can happen via bcftools concat.\nHomopolymer mode\nTo support accurate calling of reads with high rates of homopolymer sequencing errors such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads, --pairhmm-mode homopolymer should be used. This mode considers homopolymer errors to be different from gaps.\nFast mode\nPreprocessing is the most time-intensive part for variant calling with varlociraptor.\nHowever, it only has to be done once for each sample, and can be re-used for different variant calling steps.\nIn case the exact alteration fraction (variant allele frequency/allelic fraction or methylation rate) is less important for you (e.g. with large cohorts), you can add the argument --pairhmm-mode fast.\nThis will approximate the pair HMM computation of Varlociraptor by just considering the optimal alignment path, thereby changing the computation of the allele likelihoods from quadratic to linear.\nIn rare cases this can lead to wrong probabilities for single reads though, such that alteration fractions can become slightly incorrect.\nCalling\nThe basic calling command is\n\nThe dots (...) refer to the selected calling mode, which can be one of the following:\n\nTumor-normal variant calling: this assumes that a tumor and a corresponding healthy sample is given.\nGeneric variant calling: via a variant calling grammar, arbitrary calling scenarios can be defined.\n\nNote on amplicon sequencing data\nWith amplicon sequencing data, variants are usually covered only by a few (down to a single) amplicon, from which many duplicates are sequenced.\nIt is important to deactivate read position bias handling via\n\nin the Varlociraptor model in such cases, because it will otherwise detect a read position bias for those variants covered only by a single amplicon. Even for few amplicons the model would otherwise overestimate the degrees of freedom, thereby leading to artificially weak probabilities.\nNote on calling known variants\nWith known variants as input, it is advisable to disable the alternative locus bias detection of Varlociraptor.\nThis bias detection tries to find systematic association of alt alleles with alternative loci reported by the mapper or low MAPQs.\nWhile this is usually a good idea to avoid artifacts in de-novo calling, it is overly conservative when there is some prior orthogonal knowledge\nthat given variants are true.\nAlternative locus bias detection can be deactivated with\n\nTumor-normal variant calling\nLet tumor.bcf and normal.bcf be the preprocessed observations (see above) of the tumor and healthy/normal sample, respectively.\nThen, variants of all lengths can be called with\n\nwith 0.75 being the purity (i.e. the cancer cell content) of the tumor sample.\nThe result is a proper stastistical assessment of the somatic and germline variants, without the need to apply any ad-hoc filtering.\nInstead, it should be followed by controlling the false discovery rate over the desired events, see Filtering.\nThe generated output format (both before and after any filtering), including all provided information, is described here.\nGeneric variant calling\nThe generic mode allows to define a calling scenario via a variant calling grammar.\nThe grammar allows to define the desired scenario in a YAML file.\nFor example, the following defines a normal/tumor/relapse model with a uniform prior (i.e., joint calling of tumor and relapse after therapy against normal):\n\nIn the following, we briefly describe each element for the grammar.\n\nsamples: this section contains the definition of the involved samples. Each sample is listed by its name (e.g. normal) which is referred to later in the events section.\nresolution: the accuracy in which the alteration fraction within continuous intervals is estimated. Intervals are evaluated via numerical integration. The grid points for that are determined via a binary search for the highest probability. This binary search stops when its left and right boundary is at least as close as the given resolution. For samples in which the exact alteration fraction is not so relevant (e.g. above in the normal sample in case of mosaicism), one can choose higher values like 0.1. For a tumor sample, the usual choice is 0.01 (i.e. alteration fraction estimates will be at most 1% away from the optimum). The default resolution if nothing is specified is 0.01.\nuniverse: valid alteration fractions in the given sample. The operator | denotes a logical \"or\". For example 0.0 | 0.5 | 1.0 | ]0.0,0.5[ means that an alteration fraction of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 or any frequency in the interval ]0.0,0.5[ (with exlcusive bounds) is possible for the particular sample. Defining a universe means that a uniform prior is used. Alternatively, when the mutation rates are known, it is possible to configure Varlociraptors joint prior distribution that allows to model population genetics, mendelian inheritance and tumor evolution. See the next section for details.\ncontamination: denotes the contamination of the sample with another sample (for example 1 - purity in a tumor sample that is \"contaminated\" with normal cells), given by its name after the by key, and the fraction of contamination after the fraction key.\nevents: this section contains the definition of events that shall be evaluated. Each event is a boolean logic formula over operands that define alteration fractions or alteration fraction intervals in particular samples. These operands have the form samplename:spec, where spec is the specification of an alteration fraction (e.g. 0.5) or an alteration fraction interval (inclusive: [a,b], left-exclusive: ]a,b], right-exclusive: [a,b[, exclusive: ]a,b[). An event formula may refer to another event by specifying it by its name preceded with a $ character, e.g., $myevent refers to the event myevent. See here for an example application of the latter. In addition, formulas my use the terminal symbols true and false.\nIn addition to using alteration fractions it is possible to define constraints over alteration fraction log2 fold changes (see event somatic_tumor). Further, simple comparisons of alteration fractions like relapse &gt; tumor are allowed.\nOne can express that an event is impossible by specifying false in the corresponding formula. false may not occur within a negated subformula.\nexpressions: analogous to events, expressions allow to define formulas, each with a given name. However, expressions are by default ignored, and have to be explicitly used from within events formulae. For example, let myexpr be the name of an expression, then it can be used in any formula by specifying $myexpr.\n\nFor each variant, Varlociraptor will calculate the probability of each defined event to be true.\nLet scenario.yaml be the defined calling scenario (e.g., as above).\nLet relapse.bcf, tumor.bcf, and normal.bcf be the preprocessed observations of relapse, tumor and healthy/normal sample, respectively, as defined above.\nThen, the calling command would be\n\nNote that now, observation files are given with a leading name, which has to correspond to the name defined in the scenario YAML.\nThe result is a proper stastistical assessment of the desired scenario, without the need to apply any ad-hoc filtering.\nInstead, it should be followed by controlling the false discovery rate over the desired events, see Filtering.\nThe generated output format (both before and after any filtering), including all provided information, is described here.\nImportant notes on event design\n\nIf a sample is not mentioned in an event formula, it is automatically added based on prior or universe definition (e.g., the germline event above only mentions the normal sample, the tumor and relapse samples are implicitly added by Varlociraptor based on the definition of the universe (here) or prior assumptions (below)).\nThe absent event (i.e. here tumor:0.0 &amp; normal:0.0 &amp; relapse:0.0) is always added implicitly and does not need to be defined.\nFor proper results, the given events have to cover the entire range of possibible alteration fraction combinations. Otherwise, the calculated posterior probabilities would be biased. This means that you should carefully check whether each combination of alteration fractions that you consider biologically possible is covered by one event. In turn, this also means that you can intentionally leave out a combination of alteration fractions that you explicitly do not want the model to consider as a possibility.\nFor proper results, event definitions should be disjoint. That means, that there should be no combination of alteration fractions over all involved samples for which more than one event is true. For example, in the scenario above, the germline and the somatic_normal event are disjoint because the normal sample frequency ranges do not overlap. If somatic_normal would have been (wrongly) defined as normal:]0.0,0.5], there would be an invalid overlap which can distort the resulting posterior probabilities as Varlociraptor considers each defined event to be independent.\n\nConfiguring the joint prior distribution\nWhen mutation rates for the species you investigate (or the tumor) are known, it is possible to inform Varlociraptor about such prior knowledge, including inheritance relations.\nWith sufficient evidence, such prior knowledge is less important, however, it can play a role in corner cases (in particular at low coverage), and it can help the system to make the correct decision in case of ambiguity.\nIt can also help a lot to distinguish between artifacts and true variants.\nIn the following example, instead of defining uniform alteration fraction universes as above, we define the inheritance relationship between samples and the properties of the underlying species.\n\nCompared to the initial normal/tumor/relapse with a uniform prior example shown above, some new elements appear:\n\nspecies: here, properties of the underlying species are defined, that is, the genome size (needed for the somatic prior), the heterozygosity (fraction of expected heterozygous sites), the germline mutation rate (for de novo mutations during the mendelian inheritance process), the ploidy for each sex. For the latter, all denotes the ploidy of all chromosomes, while below special cases are listed, e.g., for X and Y chromosomes.\nsex: denotes the sex of each sample, thereby defining the ploidy, which is taken from the species definition (can be female, male, or arbitrary additional identifiers).\nsomatic-effective-mutation-rate: denotes the expected fraction of non-lethal de novo somatic mutations, independent of their frequency, in the genome. In other words, the given rate denotes the probability to encounter a somatic mutation at any random site in the genome, and all possible VAFs &gt; 0.0 are thereby equally likely. The latter is an important simplification as usually the effects affecting the VAF (the point in time of the mutation, overlapping CNVs) are unknown a priori and would unnecessarily constrain the variant call. Instead, once the model decides for the existence of a somatic mutation, the VAF is driven purely by the data. Somatic mutation rates will usually differ between normal (can be found in literature) and tumor samples, and should be estimated or looked up for a given tumor instance. Note that it is also possible to simply define an alteration fraction universe for a tumor sample, thereby avoiding to specify a somatic effective mutation rate, in case it is still unknown. In that case, a uniform prior would be used for the tumor, while the rest of the sample would be treated according to the defined population genetic and mendelian priors.\ninheritance: Relationship to other samples. Inheritance can be mendelian (here, the daughter inherits from father and mother), or clonal (here, the tumor inherits from the normal tissue of the daughter). In case of the latter, it has to be specified additionally whether somatic mutations from the parental clone are inherited or not. Further, subclonal inheritance can be specified, which describes the case where e.g. one tumor sample inherits from another tumor sample (e.g. modeling a relapse or metastasis situation).\n\nAll other keywords can be looked up in the section above.\nGrammar applications\nVarious concrete applications of the grammar can be found in the Varlociraptor Scenario Catalog.\nYou are welcome to submit further applications there.\nMethylation Calling\nVarlociraptor supports the detection of methylation. Candidate methylation sites can be generated from a reference genome using the methylation-candidates subcommand. Specify the methylation motifs of interest as a comma-separated list. Supported motifs are: CG, CHG, CHH, GATC.\nThe command for the creation of a candidate file would be\n\nThe candidates can be given to the regular varlociraptor preprocess variants subcommand (see above).\nThereby, Varlociraptor though needs to know how to infer methylation from the given alignment file. The type of methylation information must be specified via --methylation-read-type &lt;type&gt;, where &lt;type&gt; is either:\n\nconverted: reads treated with bisulfite or enzymatic conversion, typically used for short-read methylation inference. Unmethylated cytosines have been transformed to thymines.\nannotated: reads with methylation information in the MM and ML tags of the BAM/CRAM file, typically used for long-read methylation inference.\n\nAfter preprocessing, calling can be performed as described above, with a scenario that would typically be specific for the methylation calling, e.g. describing relations between multiple samples and events of interest.\nUntil further investigation of methylation priors, the alteration fraction (i.e. here methylation rate) universe should be defined as uniform and continuous (universe: [0.0,1.0]).\nSupported variant types\nVarlociraptor implements support for all kinds of variants in all length ranges\n\nSNVs,\nMNVs (multiple nucleotide variants, as called by e.g. Freebayes),\nreplacements (small and large),\nInsertions (small and large),\nDeletions (small and large),\nInversions (small and large),\nDuplications (small and large),\nBreakends,\nMethylation.\n\n","id":"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/calling/","title":"Calling variants"},"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/estimating/":{"body":"Estimating alignment properties\nIn order to judge about candidate indel and structural variants, Varlociraptor needs to know about certain properties of the underlying sequencing experiment in combination with the used read aligner.\nThis includes the maximum feasible softclip size of the aligner, the insert size of the sequencing library, the expected amounts of homopolymer errors and the probabilities of opening and extending gaps.\nWhile Varlociraptor is able to estimate these on the fly, it is recommended to perform this estimation per sample before processing variant calls, in order to save time upon repeated runs or during parallelization.\nGiven that the sample is given as a sorted (by position) BAM file sample.bam, estimation can be performed as\n\nBy default, varlociraptor uses all suitable alignments in the provided file, use --num-records NUM to restrict the number of alignments used.\nThe alignment properties can then be passed on to varlociraptor preprocess variants, see Calling variants.\nEstimating mutational burden\nVarlociraptor enables an uncertainty aware computation of the mutational burden (or tumor mutational burden (TMB) in a tumor context).\nMutational burden is usually defined as the number of non-synonymous coding mutations per megabase of the measured coding genome (in tumor context restricted to e.g. somatic mutations).\nWith\n\nVarlociraptor will produce a Vega-Lite specification of a plot, where the x-axis depicts the\nminimum alteration fraction (here variant allele frequency/allelic fraction), and the y-axis shows the mutational burden in mutations per megabase.\nThe input file calls.annotated.bcf has to be a VCF/BCF file that has been obtained from Varlociraptor and annotated with e.g. SnpEff, such that Varlociraptor can select non-synonymous coding mutations.\nThe vega specification is a text file in JSON format, that can be converted to e.g. an SVG image via the Vega-Lite command line utilities:\n\nNote that the coding genome size given with --coding-genome-size has to reflect the measured part of the coding genome.\nIn case the estimation is conducted on e.g. panel sequencing (where only a small number of genes is captured), the value has\nto be the size of the coding genome within this capturing.\nAfter using vl2svg for conversion of the JSON to an image, the result can look like this:\n\nImportantly, the mutational burden is calculated as expected value over the posterior probabilities for each variant to be of the event of interest (e.g. somatic).\nHence, the mutational burden estimate properly considers the uncertainty in the data.\nMoreover, as we show a mutational burden estimate for each minimum alteration fraction, it becomes possible to reason e.g. over the clonal structure\nof a tumor, instead of considering only a single overall number. We expect this to increase the predictive power of\nmutational burden analyses.\n","id":"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/estimating/","title":"Estimating properties"},"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/filtering/":{"body":"Varlociraptor provides built-in filtering mechanisms. Most importantly, these are designed to only require a single, meaningful parameter.\nFiltering by controlling FDR\nVariant calls from varlociraptor can be filtered by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). You can choose to either control the global or the local FDR.\nWe recommend the local FDR for the following reason.\nControlling the global FDR means that Varlociraptor will try to find a set of variants that most closely reaches the given FDR threshold.\nHence, it will start with the very clear cases, followed by borderline cases, and if there is still something left up to the desired threshold, it will even add clearly wrong variant calls, just to guarantee that the FDR is as close as possible to the desired threshold.\nIn contrast, local FDR control means that for each individual variant call, the probability to be a false discovery may not exceed the given threshold.\nThis leads to more intuitive results, since no obvious false positives are inserted just to reach the desired threshold as it happens with global FDR control.\nSmart vs. strict mode\nIn either case (local or global), you can choose between smart or strict FDR control.\nIn the latter case, Varlociraptor controls the FDR over the sum of the posterior probabilities of the chosen events of interest (the events you want to filter for, see below).\nIn the former case, Varlociraptor first controls the FDR over the probabilities for the variants to be present (i.e. not absent and not being an artifact). Second, it keeps only those variants that pass the FDR control and in addition where the posterior probabilities for the events of interest sum up to at least 50% probability.\nThe smart mode leads to more intuitive results, as it successfully captures borderline cases between different events, while effectively removing false positives. It is therefore recommended to use the smart mode (as we also do in all examples below).\nRetaining artifacts\nDepending on the use case, it can be desired to consider variants marked as potential artifacts as wanted or unwanted when performing FDR control. For this purpose, Varlociraptor offers the flag --smart-retain-artifacts.\nThe flag is only considered in smart mode.\nWhen the flag is activated, the artifact event is not considered when deciding about presence or absense of the variant (i.e. the probability for presence becomes 1 - the probability of the absent event).\nUsing the flag can be useful when maximum sensitivity is wanted and the user intends to carefully investigate artifact calls manually instead of filtering them out during FDR control.\nControl local FDR\nLet calls.bcf be the output of the varlociraptor calling command.\nThen, by running e.g.\n\ncalls can be filtered to all single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that newly occur in a tumor sample (i.e. are somatic) with a local FDR of 5%.\nControl global FDR\nFor controlling the global FDR, you could issue the following command:\n\nThe reason for stratifying by variant type here is that their probabilities can fall into largely different ranges.\nFor example, most likely the probabilities for SNVs are likely much stronger than for indels and structural variants.\nHence, performing a combined instead of stratified FDR control would lead to a domination of SNVs in the resulting set.\nInstead, by stratification we get the maximum resultion for each type of variant in case of global FDR control.\n","id":"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/filtering/","title":"Filtering variant calls"},"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/installation/":{"body":"Via Bioconda\nVarlociraptor can be best installed via Bioconda.\nAfter having Bioconda set up as outlined in the docs, you can install varlociraptor into an isolated software environment via\n\nThen, activate the environment via\n\nAfterwards, varlociraptor will be available in your $PATH, such that you can issue\n\nto inspect the command line interface.\nIn any case, make sure you have the latest stable version by comparing with what is printed by\n\nVia Cargo\nAlternatively you can install varlociraptor via the Rust package manager Cargo.\nFor building, it needs the following dependencies (including headers):\n\nzlib\nbzip2\nxz\nGSL (if you have GSLv2, you need to specify --features gslv2 in the command below)\ncmake\n\nGiven that Cargo is installed in your system, run\n\nAfterwards, varlociraptor will be available in your $PATH, such that you can issue\n\nto inspect the command line interface.\n","id":"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/installation/","title":"Installation"},"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/model/":{"body":"Underlying varlociraptor is a novel theory of variant calling that is able to handle all length ranges (from small to SV) in a unified way, while allowing to include any kind of uncertainty (mapping, typing, strand, read orientation, ...).\nThe basics of the model are described in the initial publication, which focuses on the application on tumor/normal variant calling.\nIn the future, we will publish another manuscript that describes Varlociraptor's generic calling mechanisms.\n","id":"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/model/","title":"Statistical model"},"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/output/":{"body":"Variant calling\nInvocations of varlociraptor call variants output variant calls in BCF format (either printed out to STDOUT, the default, or saved to a given path).\nThe output follows the established standard, but adds some fields are different or have a slightly different meaning than what you might be used to from other variant callers.\nINFO fields\n\nVarlociraptor uses the usual fields to encode structural variant information (SVTYPE, SVLEN, END, MATEID, EVENT), as defined in the VCF/BCF standard.\nIn addition it provides one field for each event defined in the calling scenario (PROB_EVENTNAME with eventname is the name of the event in the scenario). These fields denote the posterior probability for this event, encoded in PHRED scale (the smaller the higher, with 0 being equal to an unscaled probability of 1). In addition to the events of the scenario, there are always the two implicit events absent and artifact (meaning that the variant in the record is not present at all or any kind of artifact, respectively), which are denoted in the corresponding field PROB_ABSENT and PROB_ARTIFACT. Together, all those posterior probabilities sum up to one (modulo minor numerical glitches caused by the encoding and available precision in BCF format).\n\nSample specific (FORMAT) fields\n\nBy default, no genotype field (GT) is provided. The reason is that varlociraptor can be used to call much more complex scenarios that cannot be captured via genotypes (e.g. subclonal variants). If you still need a genotype field and your scenario is sufficiently simple, you can use varlociraptor genotype (see varlociraptor genotype --help) to annotate your BCF file with additional, standard compliant, genotype fields.\nThe alteration fraction (variant allele frequency/allelic fraction or methylation rate) in each sample is stored in the AF field. This is Varlociraptor's actual replacement of the by default missing genotype. It allows to display heterozygous (AF=0.5) vs. homozygous calls (AF=1.0), as well as any subclonal events in between.\nThe read depth is stored in the DP field of each sample. Importantly, this depth is not an ordinary read count, but rather the expected read depth given the mapping qualities of the reads covering the variant. Mathematically spoken it is the sum of the probabilities that each read maps correctly to the locus of the variant. This kind of depth is more accurate as it takes the mapping uncertainty into account, but it may differ slightly from the read counts you see e.g. when checking the pileup in IGV.\nThe SAOBS field provides a simplified summary of the observations (e.g. read alignments) favoring the alternative (ALT) allele (has to be considered together with SROBS). Each entry is encoded as CB, with C being a count, B being the posterior odds for the alt allele. The provided letter denotes an extended Kass Raftery score: B=barely, P=positive, S=strong, V=very strong (lower case if probability for correct mapping of fragment is &lt;95%). Note that we extend Kass Raftery scores with a term for equality between the evidence of the two alleles (E=equal). Further note that there is no N=none score, as such observations occur with an opposite direction score (odds for the reference or a third allele) in the SROBS field.\nThe SROBS field provides a simplified summary of the observations favoring the reference (REF) or a third allele (has to be considered together with SAOBS). Each entry is encoded as CB, with C being a count, B being the posterior odds for the reference or a third allele. The latter denotes an extended Kass Raftery score: E=equal, B=barely, P=positive, S=strong, V=very strong (lower case if probability for correct mapping of fragment is &lt;95%).\nThe OBS field provides a detailed summary of the observations. Each entry is encoded as CBDTASOPXI, with C being a count,and B being the posterior odds for the alt or the reference allele. The latter are given as a two letter code. The first letter (A or R) defines whether the odds favor the alt allele (A) or any other allele including the reference allele R. The second letter denotes an extended Kass Raftery score: N=none, E=equal, B=barely, P=positive, S=strong, V=very strong (lower case if the probability for correct mapping of fragment is &lt;95%). Note that we extend Kass Raftery scores with a term for equality between the evidence of the two alleles (E=equal). D denotes the edit distance to the ALT allele in case it is higher than what could be expected from sequencing errors (in that case, Varlociraptor derives a third allele from the read sequence and considers that as an alternative to the alt allele, instead of the reference allele), T being the type of alignment, encoded as s = single end and p = paired end, A denoting whether the observations also map to an alternative locus (# = most found alternative locus, * = other locus, . = no locus), S being the strand that supports the observation (+, -, or * for both), O being the read orientation (&gt; = F1R2, &lt; = F2R1, * = unknown, ! = non standard, e.g. R1F2), P being the read position (^ = most found read position, * = any other position or position is irrelevant), X denoting whether the respective alignments entail a softclip ($ = softclip, . = no soft clip), and I denoting indel operations in the respective alignments against the alt allele (* = some indel, . = no indel or information irrelevant for variant type).\nThe OOBS field provides the number of omitted observations. For SNVs and MNVs, read pairs are omitted if they have a non-standard read orientation (neither F1R2 nor F2R1) as those can frequently lead to alignment artifacts.\nThe SB field denotes the strand bias estimate: + indicates that ALT allele is associated with forward strand, - indicates that ALT allele is associated with reverse strand, . indicates no strand bias. Strand bias is indicative for systematic sequencing errors. Probability for strand bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).\nThe ROB field denotes the read orientation bias estimate: &gt; indicates that ALT allele is associated with F1R2 orientation, &lt; indicates that ALT allele is associated with F2R1 orientation, . indicates no read orientation bias. Read orientation bias is indicative of Guanin oxidation artifacts. Probability for read orientation bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).\nThe RPB field denotes the read position bias estimate: ^ indicates that ALT allele is associated with the most found read position, . indicates that there is no read position bias. Read position bias is indicative of systematic sequencing errors, e.g. in a specific cycle. Probability for read position bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).\nThe SCB field denotes the softclip bias estimate: $ indicates that ALT allele is associated with with softclips in the same alignment, . indicates that there is no softclip bias. Softclip bias is indicative of systematic alignment errors, cause by a part of the read that does not properly align to the reference (and is thus soft clipped). Note that softclips can also be caused by structural variants. However, structural variants on the same haplotype as e.g. an SNV should not cause a softclip bias, because there will usually still be reads that do not reach the SV, thereby providing evidence against a softclip bias. Probability for softclip bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).\nThe HE field denotes the homopolymer error estimate: * indicates that ALT allele is associated with with homopolymer indel operations of varying length, . indicates that there is no homopolymer error. Homopolymer error is indicative of systematic PCR amplification errors. Probability for such homopolymer artifacts is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).\nThe ALB field denotes the alt locus bias estimate: * indicates that ALT allele is systematically associated with either MAPQs smaller than the maximum MAPQ or a major alternative alignment (XA tag) reported by the used read mapper. This would be indicative of ALT reads actually coming from another locus (e.g. some repeat, a homology, a distant variant allele, or a CNV). Probability for alt locus bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).\nThe AFD field provides the sampled posterior probability densities of alteration fractions in PHRED scale (the smaller the higher, with 0 being equal to an unscaled probability of 1). In the discrete case (no somatic mutation rate or continuous universe in the scenario), these can be seen as posterior probabilities. Note that densities can be greater than one. Further note that the densities of each sample are conditional on the maximum a posteriori alteration fractions of the other called samples.\n\n","id":"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/output/","title":"Output format"},"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/reporting-issues/":{"body":"For reporting issues, please use our issue tracker.\nIf problems entail certain variant calls, it is particularly easy to create a proper test case with varlociraptor (see below).\nIssues with called variants\nIf you have the feeling that a variant call from varlociraptor is wrong, we would be grateful to receive a test case.\nFor this purpose, varlociraptor provides an interface to automatically create test cases from runs.\nLet\n\nbe the original command you ran which yielded a variant call you believe to be wrong.\nThen, you can issue\n\nwith CHROM:POS being the locus of the variant as it is defined in the vcf file (1-based position).\n--testcase-anonymous will try to anonymize as much information in the test case as possible, anonymizing identifiers (via uuid4) and sequences (by randomly permuting the alphabet).\nVarlociraptor will then create a folder under the given prefix (here testcase), containing\n\nrelevant subsets of the given BAM files (the reads around the locus),\na VCF file with the candidate variant,\na file testcase.yaml containing the used parameters, the reference sequence around the variant, and sample information.\n\nThe testcase.yaml looks similar to this:\n\nThe first section expected, has to be edited by you in order to denote the expected alteration fractions (variant allele frequencies/allelic fractions or methylation rates), and the posterior probabilities.\nThereby, both fields are optional.\nFinally, the testcase can be zipped and attached to a new issue in our issue tracker.\nBefore uploading a testcase like this, make sure that the testcase does not contain identifying information about your samples (e.g., no clear names in files).\nIn general, even creating test cases from clinical samples might be fine, because they only contain reads around the problematic locus.\nOf course, that decision is up to you.\nIn any case, your help with improving varlociraptor is greatly appreciated.\n","id":"https://varlociraptor.github.io/docs/reporting-issues/","title":"Reporting issues"},"https://varlociraptor.github.io/landing/":{"body":"\n\nFlexible, arbitrary-scenario, uncertainty-aware variant calling  with parameter free filtration via FDR control.\n\n\n\nKey features\n\nCalls SNVs, MNVs, indels, arbitrary replacements, inversions, duplications, haplotype blocks (combinations of any of the previous), methylation and breakends.\nSupports all length ranges (from small to structural) with a unified statistical model.\nThe statistical model entails all possible sources of uncertainty (mapping, typing, heterogeneity) and biases (strand, read pair orientation, read position, sampling, contamination, homologous regions).\nResulting variant calls can be filtered by false discovery rate.
